Schlumbohm.</p>\n<p>Applying his knowledge of filtration and extraction, Mr. Schlumbohm was able to craft the vessel that would pour the perfect cup of joe. The angles of the drip, thickness of the filter paper and the air vent chamber allow coffee to brew in a specified time and release gases that are usually trapped in by other brewing methods. This results in a smooth, bitter-free cup in less than four minutes.</p>\n<p>Made of labratory heatproof borosilicate glass with a simple wooden handle, the Chemex coffeemaker's design has been inducted in to the permanent collection of The Museum of Modern Art.</p>\n<p>Measures 21 cm h x 7.6 cm dia/8.25 in h x 3 in dia</p>\n<p>Capacity 473 ml/1 Pint</p>",

Top of the list would have to be Solomon Shereshevsky, who remembered every single thing he&rsquo;d ever come across &ndash; a great skill to have when it came to party tricks, but enough to send him crackers. And then there&rsquo;s Delbert Trew who spends more time than you can imagine thinking about something very sharp indeed: barbed wire. You can&rsquo;t go past Samuel Morse, either, who was a famous portrait painter before he gave his name to the code he invented. What a genius! And we&rsquo;re pretty taken with Noel Turner, who was smart enough to get around some pretty weird New Zealand laws to invent a car that, for a while, was a huge success. As well, you&rsquo;ll find stories on a cross-dressing spy, a couple of Sydney nerds who revolutionised modern music, court illustration, big wheels, the dubious science of controlling the weather and a whole stack of other stuff.</p>\n<p>143 Pages</p>",

The Swiss-precision movement powering a pink mother of pearl dial with rose-gold colored indices and hands brings the luxury of functionality. The mineral glass encasing the quartz movement is built to last and adds a sense of durability. An analog battery brings lasting power to the watch, and a water-resistant rating of 3 ATM finishing off the design.
